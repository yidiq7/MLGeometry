# Leaderboard

## Work in progress

Here we will give both leaderboard and a link to a script which does the following:

Run 5 prechosen sample CYs and apply the following criteria:
1. No more than 2 hours time per run (we will run submissions on our cluster).
2. Do each run twice with two choices of random seed and keep the worse one.
3. All runs must meet some minimal accuracy (e.g. 1% MAPE).
4. Rank the qualifying entries by average MAPE (over all samples).
